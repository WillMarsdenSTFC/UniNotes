| Increase knowledge, expertise and experience using Totara based Learning Management System. | My job title is LMS Technical Support, my job is to do all technical aspects of the Training team as well as provide support when issues occur on the LMS for both internal and external users. This has required me to learn about Totara LMS' so that I can be effective at my job and provide support to keep everything running. | I am quite proficient and comfortable with the Totara system and have completed their full catalogue of LMS Manager training activities. I was at the forefront when we decided to switch to seminars instead of manually emailing users a zoom link. This change required knowledge of how seminars are used and how they worked and in the end allowed us to automate a large amount of our live sessions whilst also being able to send notifications and calendar reminders to users. | - Completed all Site Administrator Totara Academy courses    - Creating new course pages for topics such as, "Practical Guide to DevOps for AI".    - Implementing the seminars feature for all pre-existing courses to allow for better live sessions.    -   |  |

|Increase my knowledge of Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the Python programming language. |Despite being in different departments, as part of my technical focused apprenticeship, I regularly work with Technical Services Operation Group (TSOG) who work with our High Performance Computers (HPC) and Supercomputers. This meant that TSOG asked me to create a demo application simulating the mathematical visualisation, "Game of Life" for their Raspberry Pi Cluster HPC to further my software engineering skills. Therefore, relating to my job role through my University degree as well as working with TSOG. |I was able to successfully replicate, "Game of Life" through Python and the PyGame using prior knowledge of Python, however, I learnt PyGame using a youtube series listed in my references below. I successfully used MPI to run the application on 1 node (1 Computer) with multiple cores (Different parts of the CPU calculating different parts of the program at the same time). However, despite this, I was unable to get a working version of this application to run across multiple nodes using multiple cores. Hence the reasoning for increasing my knowledge of MPI. |||
