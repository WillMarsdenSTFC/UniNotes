# Who is STFC?

STFC is a research council standing for Science, Technology and Facilities Council. It is a UK Government agency that specialises in sciences ranging from particle physics, nuclear physics, space science and astronomy.

Whether we are building or upgrading the large hadron collider in Switzerland 175 meters under Geneva, 1.1km below ground in a salt mine in Yorkshire trying to catch dark matter and neutrino particles or manufacturing parts for the James Webb telescope, which is now 1 million miles away from earth.

In 1957, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was built near Oxford to conduct research on proton linear accelerators and 5 years later, Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire was built. Both laboratories contributed to the research of X-Rays and in 1979, the IBM 370/165 computer called, "The Cray" was installed in Daresbury and was the first machine to merit the title of Supercomputer and was able to perform over 100 million calculations per second beginning a new era of computing and supercomputing. 

More recently, STFC was absorbed by a public body known as UKRI (UK Research & Innovation) in 2018 along with 8 other research councils and 2 additional bodies, Innovate UK and Research England. This has created many more opportunities using UKRI's 8 billion pound annual funding and has allowed STFC to continue cutting-edge science as well as cutting-edge computing.
