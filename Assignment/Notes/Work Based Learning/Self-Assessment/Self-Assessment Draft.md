# Who is STFC?

STFC is a research council standing for Science, Technology and Facilities Council. It is a UK Government agency that specialises in sciences ranging from particle physics, nuclear physics, space science and astronomy.

Whether we are building or upgrading the large hadron collider in Switzerland 175 meters under Geneva, 1.1km below ground in a salt mine in Yorkshire trying to catch dark matter and neutrino particles or manufacturing parts for the James Webb telescope, which is now 1 million miles away from earth.

In 1957, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was built near Oxford to conduct research on proton linear accelerators and 5 years later, Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire was built. Both laboratories contributed to the research of X-Rays and in 1979, the IBM 370/165 computer called, "The Cray" was installed in Daresbury and was the first machine to merit the title of Supercomputer and was able to perform over 100 million calculations per second beginning a new era of computing and supercomputing. 

More recently, STFC was absorbed by a public body known as UKRI (UK Research & Innovation) in 2018 along with 8 other research councils and 2 additional bodies, Innovate UK and Research England. This has created many more opportunities using UKRI's 8 billion pound annual funding and has allowed STFC to continue cutting-edge science as well as cutting-edge computing.

# Corporate Plan

STFC has 6 corporate objectives, mostly aimed at making the UK an innovative and world leading country. The first objective is to use a single fund of £2 billion pounds to increase investment in people, culture and talent portfolio by 26% by 2025. This hopefully ensures the UK is able to respond rapidly to emerging opportunities such as Daresbury's new "PsiQuantum" department, building our first quantum computer.

STFC hopes to focus on making the UK a top attraction for researchers and innovators to advance the frontiers of human knowledge by investing a further £3.8 billion in investigator-led research by 2025.


# My role

Whilst my role may not be directly linked to Software Engineering, I come from a coding and technical background and have been since I was 10 years old. I have always known that I wanted to be a software engineer and enjoy the challenges posed, so when I saw an apprenticeship advert at STFC for a LMS Technical Support Apprentice with the software engineering degree pathway, I applied.

In my role, I handle all technical aspects of the training department. We create training courses to help UK industries and businesses adopt new and exciting technology such as quantum computing, high-performance computing and machine learning. This required me to learn a whole new system called a LMS, a learning management system, to deliver these courses.

I was also required to learn about Jupyter notebooks and the subsequent Jupyter Hub that will be used to provide practical training by allowing users to create their very own code environments based off images so that learners can code straight away without the installation of tools, frameworks and other integrated developer environments. This also needed a basic understanding of Github and Gitlab, which needed to be maintained by me, as that is how the images were created.
