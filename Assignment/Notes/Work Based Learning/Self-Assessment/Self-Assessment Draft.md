# Who is STFC?

STFC is a research council standing for Science, Technology and Facilities Council. It is a UK Government agency, belonging to the department of Science and Innovation, that specialises in sciences ranging from particle physics, nuclear physics, space science and astronomy.

STFC built and are currently upgrading the large hadron collider (CERN) in Switzerland, which is 175 meters under Geneva and 11 miles in length. They are also trying to catch dark matter and neutrino particles 1.1km below ground in a salt mine in Yorkshire. Furthermore, we manufactured parts for the James Webb telescope, which is now 1 million miles away from earth, orbiting the sun.

In 1957, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory was built near Oxford to conduct research on proton linear accelerators. 5 years later, Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire was built. In 1979, the IBM 370/165 computer called, "The Cray" was installed in Daresbury and was the first machine to merit the title of Supercomputer. It was able to perform over 100 million calculations per second, launching the UK into a new era of computing and supercomputing. 

More recently, STFC was absorbed by a public body known as UKRI (UK Research & Innovation) in 2018 along with 8 other research councils and 2 additional bodies, Innovate UK and Research England. This has created many more opportunities using UKRI's 8 billion pound annual funding and has allowed STFC to continue cutting-edge science as well as cutting-edge computing.

# Corporate Plan

STFC has 6 corporate objectives, mostly aimed at making the UK an innovative and world leading country. The first objective is to use a single fund of £2 billion pounds to increase investment in people, culture and talent portfolio by 26% before 2025. This hopefully ensures the UK is able to respond rapidly to emerging opportunities such as Daresbury's new "PsiQuantum" department, building our first quantum computer.

STFC hopes to focus on making the UK a top attraction for researchers and innovators to advance the frontiers of human knowledge by investing a further £3.8 billion in investigator-led research by 2025.


# My role

In my role, I handle all technical aspects of the training department. We create training courses to help UK industries and businesses adopt new and exciting technology such as quantum computing, high-performance computing and machine learning. This required me to learn a whole new system called a LMS, a learning management system, to deliver these courses.

I was also required to learn about Jupyter notebooks and the service, Jupyter Hub, that will be used to provide practical training by allowing users to create their very own code environments based off images. This enables learners to code instantly without the installation of tools, frameworks and other integrated developer environments. This also required a basic understanding of Github and Gitlab, which are needed to be maintained by me, as that is how the images are created from.


# Relevance to Apprenticeship standards

Although my role is not directly linked to Software Engineering, I have had projects with other departments which involve key duties of the software engineering pathway duties. 

One of these that can be exampled is when I created the, "Game of life" game for a high-performance Raspberry pi cluster for demonstration purposes. To make sure the needs of the department were fulfilled, I gathered the requirements needed such as making sure the game ran on multiple cores across multiple nodes using MPI (Message Passing Interface). This is relevant to my role as I work along-side Technical Services Operation Group (TSOG) to offer and receive technical support. It is also relevant to STFC as my game will be shown in public engagement events, which could benefit their public image or increase demand for jobs and apprenticeships by showing off their work.
