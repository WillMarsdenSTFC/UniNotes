# Data Model
Develop a Data Model using appropriate visual documentation methods (e.g., an Entity Relationship Diagram) which should include evidence of:
• A minimum of 3 entities.
• Attributes and their data types.
• Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK).
• Relationships between entities.
• Justifications of your design decisions.
